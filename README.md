# David Rose-Franklin React Template

This is a preconfigured React template that includes TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prettier, ESLint (Google Standard), and Husky. It provides a solid foundation for building React applications with a consistent code style and automated linting/formatting. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- React with TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience.
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive styling.
- Prettier for automatic code formatting.
- ESLint with Google Standard configuration for enforcing code quality and style guidelines.
- Husky for Git hooks to ensure code quality before commits.

## Getting Started

To create a new React application using this template, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Use the following command to create a new React application based on this template:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template drf-react-template
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
